# Disaster Response Optimization using AI Techniques

This repository contains a comprehensive simulation for optimizing disaster response operations using various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization (ACO), minimax with alpha-beta pruning, game theory, and Bayesian networks.

## Project Overview

This project leverages a multi-faceted AI-driven approach to optimize rescue operations during a disaster scenario. The simulation integrates several AI techniques to address critical aspects of emergency response, such as pathfinding, resource allocation, strategic planning, and probabilistic inference.

### Key Techniques Used:
1. **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: Optimizes rescue paths for minimal travel time under challenging conditions.
2. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Simulates multi-agent coordination for resource efficiency.
3. **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes resource allocation for rescue operations.
4. **Game Theory**: Provides strategic decision-making for agent interactions.
5. **Bayesian Networks**: Models and infers uncertainties for decision-making.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `Python 3.x`
- `pgmpy` (for Bayesian Networks)
- Other standard libraries such as `random`, etc.

## Getting Started
